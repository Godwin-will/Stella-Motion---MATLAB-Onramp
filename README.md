# Stella-Motion---MATLAB-Onramp

Completing the MATLAB Onramp Tutorial Hosted by MathWorks Academy, I completed a project by using MATLAB to find the absorbed wavelength of the Hydrogen
alpha line of HD-94028 and comparing it to the known wavelength of the Hydrogen absorption to determine how fast the star is moving away from the earth.
